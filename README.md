SCION-SCXML is a lightweight SCXML-to-JavaScript compiler that targets the next generation of the SCION Statecharts interpreter. 

SCION-SCXML will take your SCXML code, and generate JavaScript modules. You can see an example of what the generated code looks like in SCION's test suite, [here](https://github.com/jbeard4/SCION/tree/core/test).

This software is still being development, and is currently unreleased. It doesn't not yet support all the features of the previous major SCION iteration, but it's getting there.
